    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risengrød, or rice pudding, has been a beloved dish in Denmark for centuries, a dish enjoyed by rich and poor alike.  But in the 1800’s, as was the case in most of Europe, there came a point when the upper-crusted bourgeoisie wanted to further distinguish themselves from the poorer, working classes and that distinction included food.  But the bourgeoisie weren’t about to give up their beloved Risengrød.  Yet to eat the common food of the poor farmers wouldn’t do either.</p>
    <p>A solution was found:  They would add some luxurious items like whipped cream and almonds and then give it a new name, a French name, of course, riz à l’amande, to give it an air of elegance.  To borrow an American phrase, now the bourgeoisie would have their cake and eat it too.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the rice, salt, lemon zest, sugar and water to a boil in a medium-sized stock pot. </li>
        <li>Boil for 3 minutes, add the milk and return to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes, stirring occasionally, increasing the frequency during the last 10 minutes to prevent scorching. </li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped blanched almonds.</li>
        <li>Let the rice cool and then chill for several hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream until it starts to thicken. </li>
        <li>Add the sugar, vanilla bean paste and almond extract and beat until stiff peaks form. </li>
        <li>Stir the cream mixture into the rice pudding.</li>
        <li>Serve the rice at room temperature with warm cherry sauce</li>
    </ol>
